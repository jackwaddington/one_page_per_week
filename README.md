# weekly_reporting
A small adventure in putting data into places...


Considering data presentation, data accuracy, what data is relevant to who and how can it be consumed...

Can we communicate relvant data, to relevant the relevant people, at low time/financial cost?

Eink can update in less than one minute, but if our data is relevant for one week is that overkill?

Does reporting have to be hard? Can I deliver at low cost, with low time, consistantly?

10 week implementation of putting a piece of paper in a communcal space.
