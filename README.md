__For some years I had the priveildge to work with a very clever CFO, who taught me about reporting.

One piece of wisdom he shared with me was "What numbers we follow is what number we change - be careful you don't follow the wrong numbers".__


Considering data presentation, data accuracy, what data is relevant to who and how can it be consumed...

Can we communicate relvant data, to relevant the relevant people, at low time/financial cost?

Eink can update in less than one minute, but if our data is refreshes one a week - is that overkill?

Does reporting have to be hard? Can I deliver at low cost, with low time, high accruacy and consistantly?

This is a 10 week implementation of presenting data in a communcal space.
